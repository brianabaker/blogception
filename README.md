### DAY 1 May 24th
Brainstorming about what I will be doing for my project 4. Came up with doing a blog application. Decided on the core technologies that I will be using. For the front-end I will be using React.js. This is be one of the biggest challenges for me since my React skills are low. As for the backend I will be doing Node.js and Express.js. I feel more comfortable with Express and since we only learned Rails for three days I do not want to spend most of my project time on Rails.
